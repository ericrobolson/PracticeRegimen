The goal is to codify a practice regimen you can build an application to run through. It should be stateful and track your progress.

# Action Items

- Determine what to write webapp in. F# + Fable? Elixir? Typescript? Go?
- I need to determine if it's better to use randomness for learning or to rotate through things. Such as learning notes on a fretboard or scales. Perhaps grabbing from a bag would be better? E.g. a cycle might start with D, then the next cycle will pull from the remaining notes. When no more remain, the bag is refilled. Might be good to do with chords and scales as well.
- Time each section. If it takes too long, instead randomize the steps and pick a set. This will help with the time it takes to complete the practice. The goal is to get through the practice in a reasonable amount of time and keep it to something that can be done each day. If it's fast, the total loop can be repeated multiple times which might help with learning.
- One cool thing to experiment with is building this into a web application and doing it from my phone/tablet/laptop. Use magic links + password authentication.
